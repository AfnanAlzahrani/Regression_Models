# Linear Regression
The most basic type of quantitative model for predicting a continuous variable is Linear Regression.
The idea behind regression is that the model represents some average values from which the data tend to regress back. This technique was first used to explore the height differences between fathers and sons. The model showed that taller fathers had shorter sons and shorter fathers had taller sons. Hence sons' height tended to 'regress' to the average.

The basic functional form of a line with a single input is y = m*x + b. Where 'm' is the slope of the line and "b" is the line's intercept. In order to find the best fit line of a given data set, we can leverage the SSE cost function.
